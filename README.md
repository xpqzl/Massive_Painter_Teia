||:-MASSIVE_PAINTER-:||
- ||: MASSIVE-PAINTER :|| - is an experimental interactive audiovisual tool designed to generate and distribute procedurally-created 3D meshes within an XYZ grid matrix. Users can customize colors, adjust parameters, and randomize values using intuitive buttons and sliders, inspiring dynamic and creative exploration. This tool was developed with a playful approach to generative art, simulating the experience of creating art using an imagined "Famiclone" console. Its versatility enables both structured control and unpredictable algorithmic results. The generated visuals results in abstract and pseudo-figurative pixel art.



------KEY FEATURES------------

1. DRAWER MODE: 
Transforms the 3D space into a dynamic canvas, turning the mesh matrix into a brush. Combining input keys and mouse controls, parameters can be adjusted in real time, resulting in intricate paintings that evoke emotions of surprise, tension, and pleasure. Draw with your mouse or use WASD keys.

2. RANDOM MOVEMENT MODE:
This mode activates the auto-drawing algorythm, where the tool takes over the creative process. The machine randomly moves, generates and modifies parameters, producing an endless variety of unpredictable and unique outputs.

3. MASSIVE ALGORYTHM:
Introduces a generative music engine that creates a real-time musical composition. It triggers samples to produce old-school jungle/drum-and-bass music, with the generated drum breaks influencing both audio and visual generator parameters. This algorithmic interaction results in a dynamic fusion of sound and visuals.

---- SFX Panel: Includes three audio effects: Filter, Pitch Shifter and Retrigger. These effects also interact with the generator parameters, adding a layer of complexity to the output.
----- DROP Button: Resets all audio effects and drops the beat.
----- RAND_FX Button: Randomizes all audio effects and colors.


---- INPUT MAP ------------

[ LeftClick + Drag ] or [ WASD ] to move
[ Hold SHIFT ]: Increase speed
[ E ] : Zoom In / [ Q ] : Zoom Out

[ MOUSE SCROLL ]:  +/- Scale
[ Ctrl + MOUSE SCROLL ]: +/-  Spacing
[ Alt + MOUSE SCROLL ]: +/-  Fill Probability

[ R ]: Randomize all parameters

[ Z ]: On/Off Rotate_X
[ X ]: On/Off Rotate_Y

[ C ]: Randomize Colors

[ V ] or [ SPACE ]: Variate Grid Seed
[ TAB ] Hide/Show UI: 1x = transparent UI / 2x = hide UI



------COLLECTOR REWARDS------------
All primary collectors will receive a unique 1/1 output generated using their wallet address as the seed for the algorithm. Outputs can be accessed here: https://teia.art/xpQzL.OUTPUTS.

--------- TROUBLESHOOTING ------------
If mouse input stops responding, click on any UI element and try again.
If you're not seeing the meshs for a long time, click in the RESET button.
If you are running the application on OBJKT.COM , be sure to enable Advanced Mode, or the application will not run.



-------- CREATIVE POSSIBILITIES --------
Human/Machine Collaborative Art: Alternate between Drawer Mode and Random Movement to create a joint art piece with the machine (Check personal and commercial licenses in the full documentation).

The mesh library, was developed using Blender's Geometry Nodes. This foundation offers endless possibilities for future expansions, including new themes, mesh libraries, and generative worlds.



------ ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS -------
Efforts have been made to mitigate potential issues for photosensitive users. While most features are safe, caution is advised when using Massive Algorithm during rapid color changes.

Use headphones for a better sound experience. Beaware of high volumes!



------- INTEGRATION --------

This token is built on a fork of Ktorn's Evolving Artwork contract, allowing for future updates, bug fixes, and feature expansions. Versions will be documented and accessible via ARKIVO.ART, which indexes HTML-based artworks from platforms like Hicetnunc and Teia.
